          Some time around the summer of 1634 AD, a large Spanish galleon known as La Xacarilla was lost en route to the Greater Antilles. In its alleged cargo was nothing of particular interest, except for one thing it was only rumored to have: The legendary Wallstein chest. This chest was said to contain a unique mix of imperial treasures, war spoils, ancient artifacts, lost books, and other priceless items.

        <p>
          Fearing a plot on his life during the Thirty Years' War, the Duke of Fierland, Albert von Walltein, had the chest secretly shipped out. Only he knew of its existence at the time. The chest was to be delivered to his friend, the captain-general of the island of San Agueda, where Wallstein was long ago promised safe haven to Wallstein should the need arise. While the treasure would be shipped out, Wallstein himself would be assassinated before he could escape. With no true heir, this was a forgotten treasure traveling anonymously across the Atlantic. However, as it neared the Antilles it came across belligerent privateers operating off of Bermuda. The crew of La Xacarilla was forced to fight for their lives, not even knowing the true value of their cargo.

          Although it survived the battle, the ship was greatly damaged. Completion of the journey was now uncertain, and the surviving crew had to work diligently to make port for repairs. Ultimately, it seems they were forced to take refuge on a small and now unknown island referred to as "Sarcosa". This island is believed to be somewhere off the coast of Hispaniola but it's uncertain which one it may refer to. All that is known is the island made for a difficult port due to its rocky shores and dense jungle.

        <p>
          Soon, the ship would find more misfortune as it encountered a powerful storm that battered it against the islands treacherous coast. This proved too much, and the ship finally sank beneath the waves. The crew was forced to abandon ship and make for the island. The last known location of the Wallstein chest ends here. However, that's not the last time we'll hear of it.

        </div>
        <p>Of those survivors who fled to Sarcosa, a few accounts remain detailing the hazardous ordeals they would later face. From disease, to hunger, infighting, and even an animal presence described as "supernatural", the survivors would continue to dwindle. Sarcosa boasted a formidable jungle so thick the light barely shined through the foliage. There was no large game and little to forage for. Most of the islands' flora grew no fruit. At night, survivors would describe the strange sounds that would emanate deep from within the jungle.</p>

        </div>
        <p>One day, the remaining survivors mounted an expedition to survey the interior. Although small, the center of the island was tall with a steep mountain. Eventually, they came across a clearing of sorts that revealed strange rock patterns. Too regular to be natural, they surmised it to be some sort of human-made structure now in ruins. As they explored deeper, the most intact ruin they came across was a sort of temple standing above the decay and overgrowth.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The "supernatural" presence mentioned before appears here. Apparently, it somehow forced or compelled the survivors into the temple. There, they saw what they claim was its lair full of bones and death. The presence kept them trapped there through unknown means. Unable to escape, they must've starved to death. Amongst them were only a few who managed to escape and transcribe these events. They were found by luck drifting on a makeshift raft by a French merchant ship where they told their stories.</p>

        <p>
          The Wallstein chest remains missing out there. Some claim its artefacts were of an occult nature and so curses those in its vicinity including the island of Sarcosa itself. Perhaps one day, it will all be found. Until then, both the wreck of La Xacarilla and the island of Sarcosa remain a mystery that some search for to this day. The last centuries have had countless expeditions all around the Greater Antilles in search of the treasure. But so they remain lost to time.
