          <h2>Restaurant</h2>
          <p>
            That's that new place. I haven't been there yet but I heard it's some sort of fusion.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="building cafe">
          <h2>Cafe</h2>
          <p>
            This is a nice spot. They have a good selection of teas. I think you'll like their matcha.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="building bar">
          <h2>Bar</h2>
          <p>
            They've been around for a while. I think they have a trivia night on Thursdays. You should check it out.

          <h2>Outfitter</h2>
          <p>
            I got my hiking boots from here. I've worn them out and I don't like the material of the new ones they sell now.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="building boutique">
          <h2>Boutique</h2>
          <p>I'm not sure how this place is still in business, but it is. They sell expensive stuff no one in this town can afford/</p>
        </div>
        <div class="building tailor">
          <h2>Tailor</h2>
          <p>This is a family run business in operation for about five generations or so. At least, it used to be. I think they're thinking of selling.</p>

        <div class="building museum">
          <h2>Museum</h2>
          <p>The city's history isn't that interesting. There isn't anything new that's going to be added here.</p>

        <div class="building town-hall">
          <h2>Town Hall</h2>
          <p>Every town has one but I'm not sure what happens here. I've never actually been inside.</p>

        <div class="building library">
          <h2>Library</h2>

        <div class="building mall">
          <h2>Mall</h2>
          <p>It's where everyone goes to buy something they don't actually need.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="building stadium">
          <h2>Stadium</h2>
          <p>This is where our local sports teams play. Go Black-Crowned Night Herons!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="building cinema">
          <h2>Cinema</h2>
          <p>Luckily, they sometimes play older films you can't find anywhere else anymore.</p>

        <div class="building hotel">
          <h2>Hotel</h2>
          <p>Believe it or not, sometimes people come from out of town to visit. And this is their only option.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="building grocery">
          <h2>Grocery</h2>
          <p>Pomegranates are hard to come by, but the bananas are plentiful!</p>
