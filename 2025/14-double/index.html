            He just sorta showed up one day. And then chose to never leave. The ugly site of him would never end. It made feel sick about myself too. Looking into my own eyes everyday. But nothing like me looking back. How could people not recognize him? Don't they know it's not the real me? Maybe I was never that impressionable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless, I have to get rid of him somehow. He's going to take over my life. He wants everything I have. That's just not fair. I'm the real me. He doesn't deserve them or their praise. He can't be better than me so easily like that.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have to eliminate him somehow. It's the only way. But, I have to do it before he realizes my plan and tries to do the same to me. No one would notice, as long as I do it soon. I'll have to be quick and cunning. He knows everything I know. That may mean he already knows what I'm planning on doing.
