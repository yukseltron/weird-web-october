                    <b>Oldfoot Mountain</b> is a 794m mountain located in Kanesue-Bend National park. It is known for its challenging hiking trails and unpredictable weather conditions. Early legends compare the mountain to malicious deities.

            in Kanesue-Bend National Park. The young hikers were last seen on October 2003 in the nearby town, but had not given out their names. They had not secured a permit and did not want to attract attention. Their belongings would be found over time as they had somehow been scattered across a wide distance around the mountain's trail to the surrounding area. One of the hikers boots was even found near the shore of

                    <b>Tree Pine Lake</b> is a glacial lake located near base of Oldfoot Mountain. It is known for its crystal-clear waters and serene environment. Despite its beauty, it is also known for its ghost stories, especially during cold nights and winter months.

            The hikers seem to have been affiliated with a local university outdoor club. They were probably experienced in hiking and camping, but the area around Oldfoot Mountain had been sectioned off to the public the last decade after the Ruckson Ski Lodge and the surrounding grounds had been closed down and sold off to private ownership. However, the area had become infamous for nighttime ghost-hunting hikes around Tree Pine Lake.

            Having presumably snuck in during the night, the group had set up a camp not too far from the lake and at the edge of the forest trail near the mountain base. They had gone in unseen, but the caretakers of the lodge reported the next morning noticing signs of trespassing left in the snow. The night before had been cold but clear. It is unknown how many nights the hikers spent in the area, but it seems in order to avoid the caretakers, they had moved further up the trail towards the mountain and into the dense forest.

            At this point they may have gotten lost, as the trail becomes less defined and the mountain interferes with navigational equipment. They had setup camp in several different areas until deciding to head up the mountain to clear the forest for a vantage point.

            Now low on supplies, the hikers may have had to also deal with a localized blizzard that had battered the area for several days. The remaining survivors would then manage to find one of the abandoned cabins from the old ski resort. Despite the shelter, the lack of supplies and harsh conditions meant that they would not last long. It is unknown what exactly happened next as none of the bodies have been found, but, blood-stained clothing would be discovered amongst their camping equipment.

        <div class="p">
          <div>
            The disappearances were strangely never reported from the outside. Local authorities were only notified as the caretakers of the lodge had started finding the hikers belongings scattered around the area. A search party was never organized as it wasn't until the ruined cabin's discovery did authorities realize it may have been a group. The cabin had five sleeping bags but personal identification items were missing. The only paper that had survived was a barely readable pamphlet for an outdoors club.

The Tree Pine Collective were known to be a secretive organization, but one that ultimately took care of the land and funded the nearby towns after their fishing, lumber, and mining industries had collapsed.

            The hikers remain unidentified and missing to this day. Authorities have closed the case as unresolved, believing the hikers had by now succumbed to the elements. The Tree Pine Collective have since placed more security and fencing around the area to deter further ghost-hunter trespassers.
