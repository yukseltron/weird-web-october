      <p>I keep picking up this signal. This weird sequence I haven't been able to decipher. It came one night when I left the radio on. I didn't expect to receive anything. Now it's been bothering me endlessly. There's gotta be more to this.</p>

      <p>Already got enough problems to deal with. But something about this feels so different. Like it's telling me something and I'm just too stupid to understand it. Like some sort of code. I have to decrypt it. It has to be saying something, I just need to figure out the mappings.</p>

      <p>If I'm sharing this with you now, it probably means I've failed and given up. I could't do it. I let my obsession consume to the point of ridicule and humiliation. I have nothing left now as a result. There is no code. There never was. All this time...</p>
