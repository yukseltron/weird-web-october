          I woke up and wasn't sure how long it had been. The drive takes a while so they say, but I wasn't ready for the drowsiness that came with it. I wanted to stay awake to see the sights moving by but I was falling asleep too easily.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top: 450px">REST STOP</p>
      <div style="display: flex; gap: 50px;">
        <button>
          B

          Took the time to stretch my legs. The drive goes on its own, sorta like a train with no train tracks needed. But you get these breaks so that the blood keeps flowing into your joints. I stretch and pee and buy some candy. There's a wanted poster behind the cashier. In big red letters it warns us about the scowling man in the area. We buy our stuff and leave.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top: 450px">NEXT STOP</p>
      <div style="display: flex; gap: 50px;">

          Sometimes you need to take a detour. Sometimes that detour needs another detour. Next thing you know, you're not sure of where you are but at least it seems to be the right direction. You take a break on the side. Getting from A to Z takes a while. Longer than expected. But I can't wait to go back to sleep. Especially out here in the quiet, lonely, and empty distance.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top: 450px">THIS STOP</p>
      <div style="display: flex; gap: 50px;">

          D

          Another break because one of us had to pee. It was impromptu again, on the side where no one else was around. At least for the first minute. Then another drive came by and slowed down before it passed us and stopped not too far away. I glanced at the dash and I couldn't believe it. There was no automated co-driver. The person was wide awake and staring back at us. At me. He was driving. And he looked familiar.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top: 450px">THAT STOP</p>
      <div style="display: flex; gap: 50px;">
        <button>
          E
        </button>
        <p>
          It was too late. Our reactions gave it away. We knew who he was, and he knew we knew. He was the man from the wanted poster. Staring right at us. Aware we were aware of him. We kept on driving. Just sitting back and pretending to relax. But he slowly started catching up.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top: 450px">LAST STOP</p>
      <div style="display: flex; gap: 50px;">

          He called us over, out of the car one by one. The drive was done, we weren't getting to our destination. This was it, this was all the road we had left. I closed my eyes and listen to the sounds of nature flowing by.
