          The Fabric
      </h1>
      <p>
        Can you imagine the consequences if you were to go through with wearing it? To feel that texture against your bare skin. To let your form be taken place by that sentient weave. The blanket enveloping you, turning you into something else entirely. Is that really worth giving it all up? To be one like many other? I hoped you had better intentions than that.
