    <h2>The Salis Stones</h2>
    <br/>
    <p>In the middle of the Kanesue Bend National Park is its famous megalithic stone circle. The ancient structure was rediscovered as recently as 1981 by archeologist Dr. MQ Salis who estimated its age to be several thousands of years at least. Despite the novel discovery, Dr. Salis would later struggle with psychosis and alleged drug abuse resulting in an accident that took her life a year later. Her parents maintain that she never did drugs and that her case should be reopened for reinvestigation. At least that's what the true crime podcast I listen to told me.</p>

  <div class="landmark-content" id="landmark-1">
    <h2>Ruckson Lumber Mill</h2>
    <br/>
    <p>This place used to be run by the Ruckson Company before it went bankrupt in 1983. Most of Shoreport's inhabitants were also employees at the mill. The company and town would never recover. Mr. Ruckson would later disappear in the valley mountains roughly 10 years later in a tragic flying accident. I passed by this place on the first day. It was absolutely decrepit.</p>

  <div class="landmark-content" id="landmark-2">
    <h2>Signal Tower AG8</h2>
    <br/>
    <p>This is where I was assigned for a repair job. Some sort of foreign overgrowth had been causing issues to the reception. It was crusty and tough to remove and would be a week-long job. The company got me an accommodation at the nearby town for a few days while I got things fixed up. It was the only hotel in town.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="landmark-content" id="landmark-3">
    <h2>Tiny's Gas and Grub</h2>
    <br/>
    <p>An old-school diner and gas station. Small place, seems there's only ever 4 people at most at a time. Makes things intimate, I guess. But, I found the food to be underwhelming. The service was decent, although I never got to find out who 'Tiny' was. I also wouldn't trust the coffee if I were to go back.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="landmark-content" id="landmark-4">
    <h2>Tree Pine Lodge</h2>
    <br/>
    <p>Mr. Ruckson's Father originally built this place in the 30s. By the 70s it was expanding into a whole resort alongside the lake and mountains. It was apparently intended to become a ski resort but instead got quietly bought by a private ownership group in the early 90s after Mr. Ruckson's financial troubles emerged. Since then the lodge has been sectioned off to the public. Although reports come in about disturbances heard late at night in the area.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="landmark-content" id="landmark-5">
    <h2>Shoreport Town</h2>
    <br/>
    <p>A small town at the edge of the river entering the grand lake. It served as a busy hub of transportation along the mighty Kanesue river. Nowadays it has been on a steep decline. The town has long lost its sheen and the few people remaining have become increasingly isolated. People didn't seem friendly. I could feel these weird looks my way. Makes me just want to get the job done and get out fast.</p>
