        "SURPRISE! HAPPY RELINQUISH DAY!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The sounds and lights are more grating than expected. I try my best to pretend to look happy or shocked. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "You must be so excited!"
      </p>
      <p>
        I really wasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Of course I am. I've been waiting for this for so long."
      </p>
      <p>
        I really, really wasn't. I had only been a part of the TPC for a few weeks now and they've already pressured me to do so much.
        At this point I wouldn't mind leaving them. But apparently the process for that was more trouble than it's worth.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, relinquish day would determine my heart is not fully invested into the collective and I would be released.
        It was easier to just wait for that day and go through it then naturally be kicked out than try to overcome the paperwork to leave earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Come now, it's time. Your heart is to be tested."
      </p>
      <p>
        My wallet has been tested far more lately by these fools. Just get it over with.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Let's do it."
      </p>
      <p>They bring me to a dark room. I barely had time to finish my cake.</p>
      <p>Wait, there's something there. It's glowing.</p>
      <p>
        "When they are one, when they are all. When the suns die and the moons fall. When the eye is opened you shall gaze into it and see yourself. Let it flow into you."
      </p>
      <p>
        I look closer. It was like some sort of eye. An eyeball. It was staring right back at me. And I couldn't look away.
      </p>
      <h2>CHOOSE CHOOSE CHOOSE CHOOSE</h2>
      <p>I felt it's voice in my head.</p>
      <h2>CHOOSE CHOOSE CHOOSE CHOOSE</h2>
      <p>Before me I saw two boxes.</p>
      <h2>CHOOSE YOUR GIFT</h2>
      <p>I felt compelled to pick one.</p>
