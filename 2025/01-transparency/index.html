      Claude G. Finn: Last seen May 2006
    </p>
    <p>
      "He felt a stir and looked over his shoulder. It felt like a hand was there. Just a presence."
    </p>
    <p>
      No, he's not some ghost. That's just some misconception. He wants you to think he messes with your memories and your mind. Tells you he's gonna watermark himself in you and you won't stop seeing him everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except he's the transparent man, no? That's the thing, he's a nasty guy. Claims he figured it out, how to turn invisible. Problem is that only his outermost layer of skin became transparent. So you see all his veins and muscles and stuff. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't imagine it was a comfortable experience for his skin. Can't be healthy having the sun expose to your guts directly like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      People say he looked flayed, skinned and still alive. Or maybe like those see-through fish. It was just nasty and sickly looking.

      His experiments focused on glass frogs. His research was primarily on their translucent skin. His notes went at length on their supposed properties for dermal concealment.
    </p>
    <p>We found a crazy amount of dead glass frogs in his supposed garage "lab". They were strewn across, left in pieces with their skin stretched out. Horrifying stuff done to these little critters. Just boxes upon boxes of dead frogs.</p>

      />
    </div>
    <p>But now he's been gone for a while. Truly invisible now, no one's seen him in years. People say stuff for sure, that maybe he did something to himself. Made his skin like that. And that it gave him some sort of disease.</p>
    <p>I mean, think about it, his innards being constantly exposed to the sun. His eyelids never being able to fully close his eyes. He could always see through them apparently, never being in darkness or able to sleep.</p>
    <p>That lack of sleep can drive someone crazy, never being able to rest. Never being able to undo what he did to himself.</p>
    <div class="img-container">

    </div>
    <p>Of course people think he just went mad and disappeared. Maybe finally went fully transparent. No one knows, because no one's seen him since.</p>
    <p>People tell their stories though. That he's been the one terrorizing people in the nearby town. A boogey man they can all blame.</p>
    <p>But he's still alive. I believe it. I almost feel him sometimes existing in the corner. Watching silently. A man driven mad and alone with no one to talk to anymore.</p>

      Contrary to statements, there remains no evidence Claude G. Finn survived his claimed self-experimentation on invisibility. 
      While his body has never been found, police find it hard to believe Claude existed let alone had the skills and talent to conduct such dangerous research.

      Some believe the Transparent Man incidents were a hoax made by the nearby town in an effort to promote the town. Others say that the real "lab" and dead frogs were from a chemical spill the town was paid out to cover up.
      Speculation exists that the said chemical leak has had a toxic effect of its own in the minds, memories, and cognitive functions of the town.

      Nothing remains certain as of today. The exact location of the town has fallen to urban legends, making any claims difficult to verify.
