        <p>This cold night. The unrelenting winds turn it into a blizzard. I feel bits of ice scrape my face. That old house glows faintly in the dark. I wonder how warm it is inside.</p>

          We weren't supposed to be here. I wasn't supposed to crash. This was just a family trip up north to visit some relatives. The same ones we hadn't seen in a long time. I don't think I even remember the last time.

          But they did send that letter. Grandma always said we owed them for something that happened long ago. Not sure what, but I guess it's something we thought we needed to repay with a visit. Now instead we're stuck out here freezing in the cold.

          As I think about it, it did feel weird coming here tonight. I can't help but feel we were being watched this whole time. Like someone or something was waiting for us. Waiting for this kind of moment, where we were isolated and vulnerable.

          Maybe these long lost loved ones of ours should've visited us in the city instead. What compelled us to come all the way here? Adventure? We've never been the outdoorsy kind. This is a step above our usual comfort zone. Why did none of us complain?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          We could've made some excuse to not show up. Say we were sick or something. But it was like we were enchanted by this idea of seeing them again, these people I can't even remember. What kind of charm did they have to convince us to come all the way here? We were stuck hoping whoever lived in this old home would be kind enough to help us out.

            Hello again, family! ∞ <br/> We were expecting you by now. Is everything alright? We're hoping you didn't get lost on us. ∞ <br/> Let us know if you need any help. Hoping everything is ok! ∞

          No one seemed to be home, but we saw lights. Someone had to be here. The doors were open and we were getting so cold, so we went in anyway. But it didn't take long for me to want to leave.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          I saw that engraving on the floor. Some sort of circle for some sort of ritual. I didn't want to be here anymore. You don't just encounter stuff like this by accident. Something was up. It felt like this was all intentional.

        <p>
          When I tried to leave, I was stopped. Everyone was too cold, too hungry, and too tired. Even if this place was unsettling, it was at least warm. And the lights worked. 
        </p>

          "Let's just find who lives here and ask them for help with the car. We don't have to stay longer than that."

      <div>
        <p>
          "Does this look like a place that expects guests? You really think they're normal people? Let's just hurry up and stay together."

          The storm intensified outside. We might be stuck here after all. No tow truck could make it all the way out here in this snow. But how long would this snowstorm last?

            Hello family, we're reaching out one last time. ∞ <br/> We're worried at this point, something has gone wrong. Things weren't supposed to happen like this. ∞ <br/> We hope you haven't found yourselves any trouble. Please let us know if you're still ok, otherwise we may have to take matters into our own hands. ∞

          We looked around but no one was home. It sure didn't feel like it. But when I sat down on the couch, I couldn't help but doze off. Each of us probably did, one by one. The warm fire someone had left behind seemed to never run out.

          My dreams were pitch black that night but I kept hearing this chanting in a low voice. It felt like someonew as whispering in my ear. Eventually when I woke up, everyone else was missing. I yelled for them, but there was no reply. Instead, I think I heard that chanting from my dream. It was coming from the door.

          The door starts opening on its own. That's when I see them.

          I start running back down the hall. I hear them yell for me in that cacophony of voices.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p style="color: blue;">
          "DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG WE'VE WAITED FOR THIS? EVERYTHING WAS READY FOR ALL OF YOU ∞. NOW HURRY AND COME HERE BEFORE WE RUN OUT OF TIME. WE HUNGER SO MUCH ∞."

          I see the markings on the ground from before. They're glowing this faint green light. I don't know why, but I felt I had to run to it. As though that would activate it somehow and save me from them.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          I could feel them reaching for me as soon as I stepped in. The light intensifies. I go blind and scream.

            Hello family! What a great time we had together. We really appreciated being able to finally reconnect after all these years. It really felt like this massive lingering weight has been lifted off of all our shoulders. Let's make sure not to let time fly by like that again. Thanks for coming by. Until next time!
