        <div class="dot" id="dot1">
          <p>They say he has four eyes. Two to see the present, one to see the future, and one to see the past.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="dot" id="dot1">
          <p>They say he grants wishes in return for sacrifices. Anything in the world in return for the flesh of your loved ones. Your heart has to be broken.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="dot" id="dot2">
          <p>They say he was found, in some valley some place no one cares about. Too far to cause trouble except for what few people came around.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="dot" id="dot3">
          <p>They say things might've changed. The air feels different around here. Like someone set him free to torment this place. And none of us understood.</p>
