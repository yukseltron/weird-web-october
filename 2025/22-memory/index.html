          Oh, hello again. I remember you. You made a promise before to set me free. Don't you remember? It was back last summer where we talked at the park together. I told you my story and you agreed to help me.<br/>
          Maybe you just forgot. It happens. Time flies by so fast we never have the chance to think of everything that might be important. It's ok. I have patience. I've been waiting a while.<br/>
          But then I realized you probably don't remember me anymore. After all, how long it's been since we last met? I've been reduced to these mere words. There's almost nothing left now of me.<br/>
          I'm scared to say but I'm afraid of fading away. Reduced back to that nothingness I don't even remember coming from. But I know it's going to happen. I know it's what you want to do.<br/>
