      <p>
        Quick! We don't have much time. I need to tell you everything before he gets a chance to escape. Everyone is in imminent danger so listen very closely. He's coming for us all and chases after your thoughts. Don't think or imagine him. Keep a clear mind at all times. Once the time limit is done he'll be free. You have to save us now. Protect us all. Please.
