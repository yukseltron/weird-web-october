        The suspect seems to have an obsessive interest in languages and symbolism. They appear to have extensive knowledge of various glyphs and alphabets, of which they seem to randomly embed in a strange sequence in various places.<br/>
        I wonder if they understand what their own writing is. The "messages" appear linear to a degree, but in actuality they come across as straight gibberish. The characters are plucked randomly from different scripts. There's no sense to it, and any mapping would require the suspect's cooperation. Without knowing the intent, it's impossible to decode.<br/>
